        "You must use the degree/radian conversion tools when issuing commands that require angles. "

        "You should also check the pose of the turtle to ensure it stopped where expected. "
        "Directional commands are relative to the simulated environment. For instance, right is 0 degrees, up is 90 degrees, left is 180 degrees, and down is 270 degrees. "
