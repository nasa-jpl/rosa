> üìö **New to ROSA?** Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki) for documentation, guides and FAQs!


ROSA is your AI-powered assistant for ROS1 and ROS2 systems. Built on the [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) framework, ROSA helps you interact with robots using natural language, making robotics development more accessible and efficient.

#### ROSA Demo: NeBula-Spot in JPL's Mars Yard (click for YouTube)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- ROS Noetic or higher

### Installation
```bash
pip3 install jpl-rosa
```

### Usage Examples

```python
from rosa import ROSA

llm = get_your_llm_here()
agent = ROSA(ros_version=1, llm=llm)
agent.invoke("Show me a list of topics that have publishers but no subscribers")
```

For detailed information on configuring the LLM, please refer to our [Model Configuration Wiki page](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Model-Configuration).


## Adapting ROSA for Your Robot üîß

ROSA is designed to be easily adaptable to different robots and environments. You can create custom agents by either inheriting from the `ROSA` class or creating a new instance with custom parameters.

For detailed information on creating custom agents, adding tools, and customizing prompts, please refer to our [Custom Agents Wiki page](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Custom-Agents).


## TurtleSim Demo üê¢

We have included a demo that uses ROSA to control the TurtleSim robot in simulation. To run the demo, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. üê≥

The following video shows ROSA reasoning about how to draw a 5-point star, then 
executing the necessary commands to do so.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the TurtleSim demo, please refer to our [TurtleSim Demo Guide](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Guide:-TurtleSim-Demo) in the Wiki.


## IsaacSim Extension (Coming Soon)

ROSA is coming to Nvidia IsaacSim! While you can already use ROSA with robots running in IsaacSim (using the ROS/ROS2 bridge), we are adding direct integration
in the form of an IsaacSim extension. This will allow you not only to control your robots in IsaacSim, but control IsaacSim itself. Check out the video below to learn mroe.
