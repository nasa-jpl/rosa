> [!IMPORTANT]
> üìö **New to ROSA?** Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki) for documentation, guides and FAQs!

ROSA is your AI-powered assistant for ROS1 and ROS2 systems. Built on the [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) framework, ROSA helps you interact with robots using natural language, making robotics development more accessible and efficient.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- ROS Noetic or higher

### Installation
```bash
pip3 install jpl-rosa
```

### Usage Examples

```python
from rosa import ROSA

llm = get_your_llm_here()
agent = ROSA(ros_version=1, llm=llm)
agent.invoke("Show me a list of topics that have publishers but no subscribers")
```

For detailed information on configuring the LLM, please refer to our [Model Configuration Wiki page](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Model-Configuration).


## Adapting ROSA for Your Robot üîß

ROSA is designed to be easily adaptable to different robots and environments. You can create custom agents by either inheriting from the `ROSA` class or creating a new instance with custom parameters.

For detailed information on creating custom agents, adding tools, and customizing prompts, please refer to our [Custom Agents Wiki page](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Custom-Agents).


## TurtleSim Demo üê¢

We have included a demo that uses ROSA to control the TurtleSim robot in simulation. To run the demo, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. üê≥

The following video shows ROSA reasoning about how to draw a 5-point star, then 
executing the necessary commands to do so.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the TurtleSim demo, please refer to our [TurtleSim Demo Guide](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/wiki/Guide:-TurtleSim-Demo) in the Wiki.
