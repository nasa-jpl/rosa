# ROSA Testing Plan

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the testing architecture for the ROSA project. It encompasses continuous testing concepts, including testing across the software development lifecycle and automated test execution.

---

## Testing Categories

The following test categories are included in our testing setup:

- [x ] **Static Code Analysis:** Checks code for syntax, style, vulnerabilities, and bugs.
- [x ] **Unit Tests:** Tests functions or components to verify that they perform as intended.
- [x ] **Security Tests:** Identifies potential security vulnerabilities.
- [x ] **Build Tests:** Ensures the code builds into binaries or packages successfully.
- [x ] **System Tests:** Validates the complete system's behavior in a production-like environment.

### Static Code Analysis Tests
- **Location:** `./static_analysis/`
- **Purpose:** To ensure code quality by identifying syntax errors, style issues, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Running Tests:**
  - **Manually:**
    1. Run `flake8 .` in the root directory.
    2. Review the output for issues.
    3. Address any flagged problems.
  - **Automatically:**
    - **Frequency:** Triggered by code changes or commits.
    - **Results Location:** `./reports/static_analysis/`
- **Contributing:**
  - **Framework Used:** Flake8, Bandit
  - **Tips:**
    - Follow PEP8 guidelines.
    - Address all critical vulnerabilities before committing.

### Unit Tests
- **Location:** `./tests/unit/`
- **Purpose:** To validate individual functions or components within ROSA.
- **Running Tests:**
  - **Manually:**
    1. Navigate to the `./tests/unit/` directory.
    2. Run `python -m unittest discover`.
    3. Review the test results.
  - **Automatically:**
    - **Frequency:** Triggered by pull requests.
    - **Results Location:** `./reports/unit_tests/`
- **Contributing:**
  - **Framework Used:** Unittest
  - **Tips:**
    - Test all non-trivial methods and edge cases.
    - Use mocks for dependencies like ROS environments.

### Security Tests
- **Location:** `./tests/security/`
- **Purpose:** To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- **Running Tests:**
  - **Manually:**
    1. Run security tests using `bandit -r .`.
    2. Analyze the security report.
  - **Automatically:**
    - **Frequency:** Nightly.
    - **Results Location:** `./reports/security/`
- **Contributing:**
  - **Framework Used:** Bandit, OWASP ZAP
  - **Tips:**
    - Regularly update the list of known vulnerabilities.
    - Prioritize fixing high-severity issues.

### Build Tests
- **Location:** `./tests/build/`
- **Purpose:** To verify that the project builds successfully into binaries or packages.
- **Running Tests:**
  - **Manually:**
    1. Run the build script `./build.sh`.
    2. Check the output for any errors.
  - **Automatically:**
    - **Frequency:** On every push to the main branch.
    - **Results Location:** `./reports/build/`
- **Contributing:**
  - **Framework Used:** Custom build scripts
  - **Tips:**
    - Ensure all dependencies are listed and correct.
    - Validate the output binaries or packages after each build.

### System Tests
- **Location:** `./tests/system/`
- **Purpose:** To validate the entire ROSA system in a production-like environment.
- **Running Tests:**
  - **Manually:**
    1. Deploy ROSA in a test environment.
    2. Run system test scripts `./system_tests.sh`.
    3. Review logs and results.
  - **Automatically:**
    - **Frequency:** Weekly.
    - **Results Location:** `./reports/system/`
- **Contributing:**
  - **Framework Used:** Unittest, Custom Scripts
  - **Tips:**
    - Replicate the production environment as closely as possible.
    - Test for performance, integration, and security.
